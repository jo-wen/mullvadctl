mullvadctrl

these are tools to make using mullvad on arch (or probably any distro that isn't officially supported) easier.
install script built with pacman in mind.

## mullvad_install.sh
run the install script to check for dependencies on your machine and then download the official mullvad scripts and signatures.
official mullvad script downloads information about configs and builds configs in /etc/wireguard/

## mullvadctrl.sh
script brings down a current connection if one exists and brings up a new connection using a random config.
script needs root because it does some wireguard stuff that needs root.
